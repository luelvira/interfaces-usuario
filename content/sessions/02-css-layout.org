* CSS Float Layout

** FLOAT

This property places an element on top left or right of its parents, allowing
text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the
normal flow of the page, keeping part of the flow.

*** Characteristics
Lost the display properties because it depends on the box layout

*** Cleaning
Sometimes we want that a floating element positioned below other floating
elements. To do it, we use the clear property that removes the default
characteristics of the clear.

#+ATTR_HTML: :target _blank

This property allows an element to be allocated below another floating element
when there is enough space to keep both elements on the same line

* Word Wide Web

** What is The Word Wide Web?

The word wide web is an interconnected system which connect a set of web page between internet. It
is important to dont confuse Internet with WWW.

WWW is only one of the application that was builded
above internet.

** Who was the creator?

Tim Berners-Lee propuse the architecture of the WWW, creatting the first Server and the first
browser on 1990, and publish it on 1991

* Components of the Word Wide Web

** HTTP Protocol

*** HTTP Methods:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_opt: allowframebreaks
:END:

This protocol provides a series of method to communicate with a server from a client. There are 6
methods with different use and rules:

**** DELETE

Method in charge of delete a resource from the server. The resource could be a file, an entry on a
database, or whatever. This method is not a default method, so should be implement by the server.

**** GET

The get method is used to ask for a resource from a serve. This method can't send data to the
server. The answer is a text which could be in different formats, like [[./html.org][html]], [[./json.org][json]] and so.

To make the request more specific, you can send some information about what you are looking up. This
values are append to the [[./url.org][URL]], as a key value, separate each one with the ampersand ~&~ symbol and
after the close question mark of the URL.

In most case, is enough with append the request values to the url. But there are occasion on which
it is not enough and you need to use the  form encoding format

#+begin_src bash
user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
curl -vvv -G http://localhost:8000/test -H "User-Agent: $user_agent" -d query=scope=1
#+end_src

#+begin_example
 Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000 (#0)
> GET /test?query=scope=1 HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8000
> Accept: */*
> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
> 
 HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
< HTTP/1.0 404 File not found
< Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.11.4
< Date: Mon, 14 Aug 2023 12:28:11 GMT
< Connection: close
< Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
< Content-Length: 335
#+end_example

****  HEAD

This method ask for the *same* headers which will be returned with the *get* method. It is useful
in some context as small computer capabilities. Imagine you haven't RAM available. You, could ask
first for the headers of the request, evaluate the /content-length/ property and act according this value.

****  OPTIONS

The method *OPTIONS* retrieve a list of method availables for a resource. This method is implement
by default in most of the servers

#+begin_src bash :results code :wrap example
curl -X OPTIONS https://example.org -i
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
HTTP/2 200 
allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST
cache-control: max-age=604800
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
date: Wed, 16 Aug 2023 15:06:45 GMT
expires: Wed, 23 Aug 2023 15:06:45 GMT
server: EOS (vny/044F)
content-length: 0

#+end_example

**** POST

The POST method allows to send data to the server. Normally, this method, produce a change on the
state of the server, for example, when a login process ends succesfully, the server create a session
to the user and works in a different way. That means that the post method is not indepondent.

#+begin_example
POST /test HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 27

field1=value1&field2=value2
#+end_example

**** PUT

With this method, we can create or update an existing resource. It means that the method is
indepondent.

#+begin_example
PUT /new.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
sontent-type: text/html
Content-length: 16

<p>New File</p>
#+end_example

*** HTTP CODES

When we ask for a resource using the HTTP protocol, the response has a status code to identify if
the answer was successfully or not. The codes are grouped in five categories.

**** 1XX INFORMATION RESPONSE

When a request gets a code between 100 and 199, the value of the response is informative

**** 2XX SUCCESS RESPONSE

In this case, the request ends successfully. The most common response is 200 that means OK. But there
is a lot of entries.

**** 3XX REDIRECT RESPONSE

With this response, the client should make another request following a new URL because the resource
has been moved temporally or permanent

**** 4XX CLIENT ERROR RESPONSE

When the client gets an error code between 400 and 499, the client performe the request with some
errors that should be fixed before trying again. This errors could be from a bad formed URL, to an
incorrect data provided to the server, including to try to access to some resource inexistent, the
famous /404 Page not found/

**** 5XX SERVER ERROR

With the 5XX error the server inform the client, that there was an error processing the request, but
it could be temporally and the error is not caused by a client's action.

** THE URL

The url is a identify for a resource on the [[./word_wide_web.org][WWW]]. The URL is formed by different parts:

*** The protocol
The protocol specify the communication schema to be used. The most known are:
- HTTP:
- HTTP:
- ftp
- ftps
- /file/: This is not a protocol by itself , it is a instruction for some programs which tell to the
  software that the resource is on the computer.

*** The domain

The domain is the namespace of the resource. When the client write a domain, there is a process on
which the computer ask for a ip associate with the domain to an DNS Server. That means, that the
client could use the domain or the ip elsewhere.

*** PORT 

The server can open many ports as a sockets. When the protocol is http, the default port is 80 or
443 if use https.

The first 2^10 numbers are port used by the operative system. After that, the user could open and
use the port which desired.

This is specially useful when working with live server as the provided by Visual Studio.

*** The path

The path or location of the resource on the server. Normally, it represent a physical location for a
file. But now, it could works as an abstraction to the server.

*** The query parameters

A list of key value pairs, joined by an ampersand, that follows the path of the URL and separate
from it with a closed question marked.

*** Anchor

The anchor is a key inside the web-page, like a section. This allows to go directly to the section
which is refereed. The character used to separate the anchor from the rest of the URL is a hashtag,
because that, we can refer to it as a hash part.

http://example.org:80/index.html?user=lucas

* Characteristics

The main characteristic of the [[./word_wide_web.org][WWW]] is the capability to connect sites with hiperlinks. This provides
an architecture not hierarchy, allowing user explore the content in a different way connecting
different ideas, intead of follow a path.

* W3C

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops standards and guidelines to help everyone build a web
based on the principles of accessibility, internationalization, privacy and security.

** Standars and Guidelines

The standards are /rules/ developed to help web developer and browser to render well a web page,
helping to make it accessible, with semantic meaning. The most important advantage about this
standard is that help to make the site visible in many devices, without many headache.

* HTML
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_envargs: [t]
:END:

HTML is a markup language (HyperText Markup Language). Is the most basic tool to build web
sites.With HTML we can define the structure of the page and give meaning to its part. Currently, the
html is combined with CSS and JavaScript

** Basic Syntax

The syntax of HTML is evolving in the recent years. Now the standard is HTML5 which proved more tag
and functionalities.

#+begin_src html
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
#+end_src

The tags have an opening part which indicates the start of this part and a closed tag end indicates
the end of the tag. The main difference between both is the slash character after the /less than/
symbol.

The tag could be wrapped by another tag. One example of that is the use of ordered or unordered
list. The tags ~ol~ and ~ul~ create its respectively.

#+begin_src html
  <p> Ingredients: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> salt</li>
      <li> 2 eggs </li>
      <li> ... </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Step 1</li>
    <li> Step 2</li>
    <li> Step 3</li>
    <ol>
#+end_src

** Attributes

In order to provides more meaning to an element, the developer could use attributes. They are a key,
value pairs which give some aditional information or functionalities to an element. There are a lot
of predefined attributes like:
- class
- id
- href
- value
And so on. Also the developer could use their own attributes, but is a good practice to prepend it
with ~data-~ to ensure that doesn't override default behavior.

#+begin_src html
<img src="img/my_image.png" />
<ul data-type="quizz">
    <li data-correct="false"> Answer one</li>
    <li data-correct="false"> Answer two</li>
    <li data-correct="true"> Answer three</li>
</ul>
#+end_src

** Semantic tags

As I mentioned, there is a meaning behind some tags. This helps to the browser and search engine.

*** header

Inside the header should be the most important part of the page. With the title, logo and a
description.

*** main

The main part of the site. In this element couldn't be repeated elements from other pages, likes
navigation links, footer or introduction

*** section

The section wrap related content, it works as a chapter of a book.

*** article

Inside the section should be at least one article that talks about a single topic formed by
paragraphs

*** nav

The navigation bar. This element contains the links to the other page or section of the web site

*** aside

The aside tag defines indirect related content surround the main text.

*** footer
The footer of a document. Typically contains:
- authorship information
- copyright information
- contact information
- site map
- back to top link
- related documents

* Introduction to CSS3

** History
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- In 1994 *Hakon Wium Lie* proposed the first approximation  of the CSS.
- At the same time, research of the CERN was trying different ways to create
  styles into the web.
- In 1996, *W3C* started recommending the first version about CSS, =CSS1=. Today
  it is the standard. Now we use  CSS3.

** Functionalities
- Developers use CSS to give style and identity to web pages. These allow web
  pages to be different between each one and improve the user experience.
- We can define styles for many different markup languages as =XML=, =SVG=, and =HTML=.
- It is a rule-based language. We define rules and apply them to a set of elements using selectors

** Syntax

To import a CSS file we should use the link tag, which asks for the file and provides it to the browser to render the content

#+begin_src html
<!-- index.html -->
  <head>
    <title>My first page </title>
    <!-- load the css style -->
    <link rel="style/sheet" href="css/main.css">
  </head>
#+end_src

Look at the link tag. It is open, but never closed. Some tag doesn't need a close tag.

#+begin_src css
/* main.css */
selector {
    property: value;
}
#+end_src

The selectors can start with =#= to refer to an ID attribute. If it starts with
a =.=, the selector looks for a class attribute. And if the selector starts with
a tag, this group applies to all tags that are referenced.

* Resume of the last session

The past week, we talk about the history of the HTML. We introduce the HTML and
highlight we will use the fifty version. Also we introduce the syntax of a html
file.

** Skeleton of a html file

#+begin_src html
<!-- index.html -->
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
  </html>
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :target _blank
The above code includes a new tag. The =meta= tag. This tag allows to include
some metadata additional. In this case, the charset encoding. If you need more
info about this tag, you can consult the [[https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp][w3school documentation.]]
* Introduction to CSS3

** History
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- In 1994 *Hakon Wium Lie* proposed the first approximation  of the CSS.
- At the same time, research of the CERN was trying different ways to create
  styles into the web.
- In 1996, *W3C* started recommending the first version about CSS, =CSS1=. Today
  it is the standard. Now we use  CSS3.

** Functionalities
- Developers use CSS to give style and identity to web pages. These allow web
  pages to be different between each one and improve the user experience.
- We can define styles for many different markup languages as =XML=, =SVG=, and =HTML=.
- It is a rule-based language. We define rules and apply them to a set of elements using selectors

** Syntax

To import a CSS file we should use the link tag, which asks for the file and provides it to the browser to render the content

#+begin_src html
  <!-- index.html -->
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="es">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>My first page </title>
      <!-- load the css style -->
      <link rel="style/sheet" href="css/main.css">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    </head>
#+end_src

The above code contains 2 important things. Look at the =link tag=. It is open,
but never closed. Some tag doesn't need a close tag. Also, we introduce the
=meta viewport= tag. This tag tells to the browser that the page should be
render according at the device size.

=Important= the css file must be inside a folder with all the css. I like to use
~css~ as name of the folder. But also you can use style or any other name which
make obviously the content of the folder.

#+begin_src css
/* main.css */
selector {
    property: value;
}
#+end_src

The selectors can start with =#= to refer to an ID attribute. If it starts with
a =.=, the selector looks for a class attribute. And if the selector starts with
a tag, this group applies to all tags that are referenced.

* What is JavaScript

** History
JavaScript, a scripting programming language, was originally created by *Brendam
Eich* in just 10 days. It plays a fundamental role in the technologies of the [[file:../01-introduction.org][WWW]]. In 2022,
98% of websites use JavaScript. It is a high-level (just-in-time compiled)
language. JavaScript conforms the EcmaScript standards.

** Characteristics
Some of the most relevant characteristics of the language are:
1. Dynamic and weakly typing
2. prototype-bases object orientation
3. First class functions

Moreover, JavaScript is versatile in terms of programming paradigms. It can be
used in various styles:
1. Event-driven
2. functional
3. Imperative
4. Programming Object-Oriented (more or less)
5. Prototype-based programming 

*IMPORTANT*
JavaScript doesn't support I/O operations by itself. It requires the runtime
system provide this functionality.

** Other uses

JavaScript has application in diverse domains:

1. *Web Browser*
2. *Server side* (node.js, bun.sh, deno)
3. *Multi-plataform* JavaScript is employed in building desktop and mobile
   applications with frameworks such:
   - Desktop:
     - Electron
   - Mobile:
     - Cordoba/ionic 
     - React Native 
4. Specific desktop applications:
   - Gnome-shell
   - Some LSP (language server protocol)

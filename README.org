* Interfaces de Usuario - Curso 2023 2024

This repository aims to provide some notes about the practical class given by me in the subject of
"Interfaces de usuario".

** Structure

As I only give the subject to two groups, the repository will have 3 branches. One for each group on
which I will use in the classes and the main branch with the content of the course update with the
changes on the other branch, but adapting these changes for a better publication.
